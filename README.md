# MicrobiomeCommunityAssembly

The code is for simulation runs from "Host control and species interactions jointly determine microbiome community structure" by 
Eeman Abbasi and Erol AkÃ§ay, 2022.

The python script "microb_comb.py" simulates all possible microbial communities each with a unique combination of Pm, Pe, Pc ecological interaction types. 
The script can be run on command line and takes in seven command line arguments:

1. Kappa (int) = 0 no host control, kappa > 1 with host control 
2. Immune microbial load (int)  = 10000
3. Immune response (boolean) = True/False
4. Change kappa (boolean) = True/False
5. Repeats (int) = 5 
6. Updated kappa (int) = default value 99, if change kappa is true then update to 0 (no host immune control),or > 1 (with host immune control)
7. Path to save (string) 

Create two folders in the path designated to save:
a) "last_500_simm": saves an average of community ecological properties for the last 500 simulations. 
b) "final_community":  saves the community ecological properties of the last simulation 

The output for all microbial communities will be saved as a numpy (.npz) file to the designated path , and will be named based on each microbial community specific parameters. The data from the simulations is used to generate the figures presented in the manuscript.
